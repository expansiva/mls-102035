# E3 — access matrix

E3 turns approved journeys into a human-approved access contract without implementing users, JWTs or
authentication. Those runtime concerns remain in collab-auth.

The LLM emits a `clarification` payload containing access profiles, `domain:code` authorities,
profile-authority grants, data scopes and disclosure boundaries. The gate validates the proposal
against the approved E2 draft. Before approval only
`l4/{module}/pipeline/e3-access-matrix-draft.json` is written.

The widget is read-only except for the adjustment prompt. A change request adds the next open E3
agent step first, records the request second and completes the current clarification last. The new LLM
round receives the complete previous draft and must return a complete replacement plus
`changeSummary`. This loop has no artificial round limit and ends only on approval.

Approval writes `l4/{module}/access/access-matrix.defs.ts`, freezes the contract under `accessHash`
and advances the pipeline to `e4-ontology`.

Key invariants:

- authorities follow the lowercase collab-auth `domain:code` convention;
- every `now` journey step is protected by at least one authority;
- all E2 actor refs are represented by an access profile;
- journeys that share operations and the same granted authorities across different actors are twins
  (persona does not create an actor); distinct data scope keeps the actors;
- external profiles cannot receive organization-wide scope;
- limited disclosure enumerates allowed information;
- read-only information needs may introduce safe future projections without granting a full business
  record;
- later phases may compile the approved contract but may not silently broaden it.

The live prompt/gate path can be exercised against an E2-approved module without changing its
pipeline:

```text
tsx --import ./test/register-hooks.mjs --import ./test/setup-l2.ts \
  mls-102035/l2/agentNewSolution/steps/e3/nodejsLiveE3.ts \
  <project> <module> [--write]
```

Without `--write` it performs no filesystem mutation. With `--write` it stores only diagnostic live
review/response files under the module pipeline; it never approves E3.

## Structural repair round

A deterministic gate finding schedules ONE repair (`e3-access-matrix-round-{round}-gate-repair-1`)
instead of failing. The rejected draft is written to the pipeline first, then the repair step reads it
back together with the numbered findings and answers through `gateRepair.md` with a complete
corrected matrix, which passes the same unchanged gate. A second consecutive failure is terminal,
with the same message the step produced before this round existed.

The repair step's args carry `gateFeedback` and `gateRepairAttempt`; both are part of the step
contract, because dropping either turns the bounded round into a plain retry or an endless one.
