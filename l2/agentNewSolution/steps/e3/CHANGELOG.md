# E3 changelog

- 2026-09-07: The access-matrix widget reads chrome from `presentation.phrases`
  (`widget.accessMatrix.*`).

- 2026-08-29: Profiles follow the same actor rule as E2: a persona is not a profile. The prompt
  forbids minting morador/visitante/jovem grants that copy the same authorities. The gate adds
  `NS4_E3_TWIN_JOURNEYS` when supplied E2 journeys share operations **and** the same granted
  `authorityRef:dataScope.mode` fingerprint across different actors. Distinct data scope
  (own vs organization) or distinct authorities keep the actors. Repair feedback tells the model
  to merge those actors onto one profile.

- 2026-08-26: `smart` still opens the E3 widget — the access review has no A/B/C signal, so missing
  signal never hides the checkpoint. `/fast` and `automatic` still skip.

- 2026-08-26: Auto-approval after a valid gate now also follows E1 `reviewPolicy.mode=automatic`
  via `helpers/ns4ReviewPolicy.ts`. `/fast` is unchanged. `guided`/`smart` still open the widget.

- 2026-08-21: One bounded structural repair round. A deterministic gate finding no longer kills the
  step: the invalid draft is persisted, the numbered findings plus that draft go back to the model
  through `gateRepair.md`, and the corrected complete matrix re-enters the same gate. Exhausting the
  single attempt restores the previous terminal failure with the same readable message. The gate is
  unchanged, and duplicate grants are never merged deterministically — overlapping scope modes have
  no total order, so folding them is a model decision. `prompt.md` and `gateRepair.md` now state the
  contract that was missing: each profile x authority pair appears in at most one grant, resolved
  either by one covering grant detailing its facets in disclosure or by distinct authorities.
  Regression evidence: the first petShop run, where one pair was split into three grants (public,
  own, related) and the step died with no repair.
- 2026-08-08: Build 32 removes the large `e2-journeys.draft.json` dependency exposed by the first
  run24 recovery. E3 now reads the approved journey index and per-journey defs through the shared
  permanent-artifact reader, and uses the approved access def as the previous revision.
- 2026-08-08: Build 31 accepts an E5 upstream-contract report as a targeted adjustment, preserves
  the approved matrix and adds only missing backend-enforceable authorities/grants. A deliberate
  approved revision records its new review round without weakening monotonic checkpoint handling.
- 2026-08-05: Added the first access-matrix contract, deterministic gate, iterative clarification
  loop, localized matrix widget and permanent hashed L4 artifact. Ontology moved to E4.
