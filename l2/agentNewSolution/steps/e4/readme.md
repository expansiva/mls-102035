# E4 — business ontology review

Inputs are the approved module contract, E2 journeys and E3 access matrix. Current-flow modules whose
E3 is approved resume this step with the explicit `new` solution mode; E4 never fabricates legacy
database evidence.

Each round first writes `pipeline/e4-ontology-plan-draft.json`, then details entities through a
`parallel_dynamic` fan-out with `maxParallel: 20` into `pipeline/e4-entities/{EntityId}-draft.json`.
Each worker submits its artifact in the strict internal `{type:"flexible",result:{…}}` envelope, so
the orchestration protocol accepts healthy worker output without a provisional failure.
The overview freezes lifecycle states, one explicit initial state, optional terminal states, named predicate-to-state mappings, optional `cardinality: singleton` (one fixed instance; omit when in doubt) and optional `mutability: appendOnly` (a registered fact is not updated or deleted; omit when in doubt) before the workers run;
workers add fields, constraints and rule ids without redefining those meanings or duplicating rule descriptions.
The deterministic finalizer repairs only missing/invalid entities once. If the aggregate gate then
fails only on derivation (`NS4_E4_DERIVATION_*`, not warnings), it starts one compact
derivation-binding pass (`Bind ontology derivations`) with its own repair budget, which replaces
only `plan.entities[].derivation` and re-runs the gate. Mixed overview+derivation failures stay on
the overview repair. It then starts one compact
relationship-binding pass, which writes `pipeline/e4-relationship-bindings-draft.json` and maps every
semantic edge to exact existing endpoint fields or an explicit MDM/derived realization. Its gate rejects
invented fields, missing edges and incompatible persistence strategies and allows one localized repair.
Only then E4 assembles `pipeline/e4-ontology-draft.json` and renders the same single ontology widget. Titles
and descriptions can be edited directly. Structural requests first persist those edits, then add the
next open E4 round before completing the current clarification.

If a task fails after entity fan-out, a new invocation may reuse the overview and entity drafts only
after revalidating the plan, every entity and the aggregate gate against the current approved E2/E3
sources. A valid checkpoint resumes directly at relationship binding; any missing or stale draft falls
back to normal E4 generation.

The gate requires coverage of all E2 journeys, all `now` features, every required carried/produced E2
`businessObject`, and every E3 authority carrying an information need. Required journey objects must
exist as an entity or projection with the same id. Entity and relationship references are closed, stored entities have identifiers,
lifecycle entities have status and an initial state that is not terminal, lifecycle predicates and terminal states contain only exact declared states, closed-domain values (states and field enums) are stable English codes with user-language `enumLabels`/`lifecycleLabels` (optional on the type; a new run backfills a missing list with a humanized code and a non-blocking systemDecision), and persistent business entities form a connected graph. Persistence
is explicit and closed: `mdm` for organization master records, `moduleDatabase` for transactions,
`derived`, `external` or `embedded` for concepts without a module table. A derived projection
must name its account (`derivation.from` / `filter` / `aggregate`); `sourceField` and `filter`
must be declared fields of `from`, and a `sum` whose sign depends on an enum uses `signBy`
instead of inventing a column. `NS4_E4_DERIVATION_MISSING` and
`NS4_E4_DERIVATION_SOURCE_FIELD_UNKNOWN` are the backstop. An on-demand export,
report, file, receipt or snapshot is `derived` unless the request asks to persist its history;
`NS4_E4_DERIVED_PERSISTED` is the lexical backstop. A core `moduleDatabase` entity that some journey
reads and no journey writes is recorded as `NS4_E4_CORE_READ_ONLY` (warning + systemDecision
`keepCore` / `projection` / `masterData`) and does not block the run. Kind, scope, idField and
mdmType must agree. A value recomputable from other records is a projection.
The widget groups entities by this destination, marks relationships that cross stores and displays the
exact fields implementing every edge.

Static field constraints are shared frontend/backend validation contracts. Named lifecycle subsets
required by a journey or access rule are explicit reusable contracts—for example,
`unfinishedWorkTask = [notStarted, inProgress]`; E5 never infers them from prose. Dynamic, time-relative,
cross-entity, authorization, transition and calculation rules belong to E5.
Aggregate projections may stand alone; a projection carrying `projectId` must still declare its
relationship to Project so later navigation receives selected context instead of a typed id.

The first gate failure persists the invalid draft and creates one bounded repair step carrying exact
gate feedback. A second failure is terminal and remains recorded in both task trace and pipeline.

Approval freezes one shared ontology hash and writes one defs file per entity plus
`ontology/index.defs.ts`, whose compact entity entries include persistence routing, then unlocks the
implemented E5 rules compiler.
