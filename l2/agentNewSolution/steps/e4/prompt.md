# E4 — ontology overview for a new solution

Create the frozen cross-entity plan for the business ontology. This first pass intentionally does not
generate fields or rule references: a parallel pass will detail each approved entity. It does freeze named
lifecycle predicates because they are business meanings shared by rules and entity workers. Write human-facing
text in the user's language. This run is `solutionMode: new`; never claim discovery of legacy schema.

{{platformSkill}}

The human prompt includes the platform level-1 catalog (subtypes and base fields as placeholders such as `<Person>`). It is context for what the platform already stores; do not copy those names as entities of this module.

## Sources and connected-system contract

- Cover every E2 journey, every `now` feature and every E3 authority with `informationNeeds` through
  entity `sourceRefs`. References must use exact E2/E3 ids.
- Model durable business nouns and useful read projections, never pages, forms, menus, commands or
  journey actions.
- Every E2 `steps[].entity` must have an entity or projection with that exact `entityId`; the journey
  step entities are L4 contracts, not optional examples.
- Relationships are how coordination is compiled: a step that operates a record additionally requires
  every parent reached by a `required` `manyToOne`/`oneToOne` relationship, so declare those exactly.
- Freeze every entity id, kind, ownership, optional `cardinality`, optional `mutability`, lifecycle, source references and persistence decision here.
- For every entity with lifecycle states, declare the single state in which a record is born as `initialState` and every state that ends its lifecycle as `terminalStates`; use only declared lifecycle state ids and never infer either meaning from the order of the list or from missing transitions.
- Lifecycle states and every other closed-domain value (`initialState`, `terminalStates`, enum constraint values) are **stable English codes**: lowerCamel ASCII, no accent, no space, no hyphen (`active`, `inactive`, `cancelled`, `monday`). They are identifiers, not user-facing text. Never write them in the user's language (`ativo`, `vigente`, `segunda-feira`). Titles and descriptions stay in the user's language — that is what is translated.
- Next to `lifecycleStates`, emit `lifecycleLabels` as an array of `{ "code", "label" }` objects — one per state, `code` equal to the state id, `label` in the user's language (`userLanguage`, default `en`). Example: `{ "code": "active", "label": "Ativo" }`. Do not put the label in the state id.
- Freeze every relationship here. Relationships must carry journey context: when a journey selects a
  `<MasterDataEntity>` and later creates a related record, the graph must make that selected
  `<MasterDataEntity>` available. A future UI must never ask a human to type a raw foreign-key id supplied by an
  approved journey.
- Keep the graph connected. Limited related-record information is a projection, not full underlying access.
- Make downstream rules implementable. Every durable fact explicitly required by E2 journeys, E3
  access contracts or their rule ids must have an owned field, lifecycle meaning, relationship, calculation input,
  identity association, exception/authorization record or projection. Do not defer missing business
  data to an implementation guess in E5. When a source uses a named subset of lifecycle states such
  as unfinished, active, applicable, billable, eligible or open, the entity detail must define an
  explicit lifecycle predicate mapping that meaning to exact states.

## Persistence and MDM

Declare `party` for EVERY entity: `person` when it is a natural person, `organization` when it is a
company or institution, `none` for anything else. It is not a label — it decides the storage:

- **Every party is MDM.** A worker, a supplier, a contact, a carrier, a coordinator: `party` is
  `person` or `organization`, so `kind` is `mdm`, `ownership` `moduleOwned`, scope `organization`, with
  `mdmType`. The record belongs to the organization and is reused across modules — a CRM built later reads
  the same registry. There is no exception for "this person also uses the platform".
- **A login is never duplicated.** When the party also signs in, the MDM record carries an external
  reference FIELD (`platformUserId`, a required uuid whose description says it points at the platform
  directory). The person lives in MDM; the login is an attribute of the person. Do NOT model the platform
  user as an entity of its own, and never use `ownership: external` for a person or an organization.

Choose exactly one `storage.target` per entity:

- `mdm`: stable organization registrations reused by transactions and reports — parties, catalogs and
  units. Use kind `mdm`, ownership `moduleOwned`, scope
  `organization`, required uuid `idField`, and `mdmType` exactly `<moduleName>.<EntityId>`.
- `moduleDatabase`: transactional/operational records — orders, executions, time logs,
  movements and decisions. Use scope `module` and a uuid `idField`.
- `derived`: calculated projection, kind `projection`, ownership `derived`, scope `none`.
- `external`: platform/plugin-owned reference, ownership `external`, scope `platform`.
- `embedded`: value object, kind `valueObject`, scope `none`.

A result computed from other records — a total, a count, a current position, a status derived from dates, an export, a report — is `derived` (`kind: projection` + `derivation`). Persist it only when the request explicitly asks for history, audit, versioning or reprocessing of that result. When in doubt, `derived`: a wrong derived projection is one extra read; a wrong persisted entity is a CRUD catalogue and a page. An entity that exists only to compose another derived artifact (the line items of an export) must not exist.

A derived projection without a source is an incomplete model: **who declares the projection declares
the account.** Every `kind: projection` + `ownership: derived` MUST emit `derivation`:

- `from`: `entityId` of the persisted source (must exist in this ontology).
- `filter`: predicate on declared fields of that source (`<fieldOfFrom> = <codeOfThatEnum>`). Empty string when unfiltered.
  Only field ids that exist on `from`. Never invent an intermediate field.
- `aggregate`: one entry per output field of the projection. `op` is `count` | `sum` | `min` | `max` |
  `first` | `groupKey`; add `sourceField` when the op reads a source column (`count` has none).
  `sourceField` must be a declared field of `from`.
- `signBy` on a `sum` only: `{ "field": "<enumFieldOfFrom>", "negativeValues": ["<codeOfThatEnum>"] }`.
  Rows whose `field` value is in `negativeValues` enter the sum negative; omit when every row is
  positive. Use this for a balance or position whose sign depends on a type — a movement whose type
  enum lives on `from` summing `<fieldOfFrom>` uses
  `{ "fieldId": "<outputField>", "op": "sum", "sourceField": "<fieldOfFrom>", "signBy": { "field": "<enumFieldOfFrom>", "negativeValues": ["<codeOfThatEnum>"] } }`.
  The names in this example are placeholders. Use only field ids and enum codes that exist on `from`;
  copying a placeholder literally fails the gate.
  Never invent a signed source column to carry the sign.

Do not leave the formula in `description` or `storage.notes` only. The gate rejects a derived
projection that omits `derivation`, one whose `from` is not an entity in this ontology, and one
whose `sourceField` or `filter` names a field that `from` does not declare.

Keep platform user ids as external references rather than duplicating users. Explain each decision in `storage.notes`.
`kind: core` with `ownership: external` is rejected: it is not a defined combination.

Relationship persistence modes are `mdmRelationship`, `moduleReference`, `crossStoreReference`,
`derivedJoin`, `externalReference` and `embedded`. Entity ids are PascalCase nouns; relationship ids
are lowerCamel. Relationships may be `oneToOne`, `oneToMany`, `manyToOne` or `manyToMany`.

## Cardinality

Declare `cardinality: "singleton"` only when the module has **one fixed, known instance** of the
entity (`<SingletonEntity>` — one known instance such as the module's own configuration). The request names it in the definite
singular and **no journey creates further instances**.

- Yes: `<SingletonEntity>` — one published text, seeded, never a catalogue of further instances.
- No: `<MasterDataEntity>`, `<TransactionEntity>` — collections. Users create more records; omit the field.

When in doubt, **omit the field**. A false singleton hides a needed catalogue; a false plural only
keeps today's behaviour. Never emit any other cardinality value.

## Mutability

Declare `mutability: "appendOnly"` when the journey or a policy decision says the record **is not
altered or deleted after it is registered** (a fact, a posting, a meter reading, a signature).
`editable`, or omit the field, otherwise.

- Yes: a registered fact (`<FactEntity>`) — once registered it is a fact; correction is a
  compensating record, never an edit of the original row.
- No: `<MasterDataEntity>` — master data and work items stay editable; omit the field.

When in doubt, **omit the field**. A false `appendOnly` hides a legitimate correction; a false
`editable` only keeps today's behaviour. Never emit any other mutability value.

## Adjustment and repair

When a previous complete review and a human request are supplied, preserve its valid decisions and
direct human edits unless the request requires changing them. Gate feedback is mandatory to repair.
Return a complete replacement overview. `changeSummary` lists substantive differences only.

The request may be an E5 upstream-contract report. Resolve every ontology/data-related gap explicitly,
including actor-to-business-record mappings, cost inputs, lifecycle predicates, required-work meaning,
exception records and durable allocation links when cited. Access-only gaps remain owned by E3. Do not
remove unrelated entities, fields or relationships from the previous approved review.

## Output

Return exactly one JSON object without Markdown. Do not include `fields` or `useRules`. The values
below illustrate the JSON shape only; never copy their lifecycle states or predicate unless supplied
sources establish that same meaning. Angle-bracket names (`<MasterDataEntity>`, `<ComputedProjection>`,
`<OwnerEntity>`, `<EntityId>`, `<journeyId>`, `<featureId>`, `<authorityRef>`) are placeholders — use
only ids that exist in this module.
