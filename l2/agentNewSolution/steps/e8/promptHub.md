# E8 — compose the hub record page

You are given the CLOSED catalogue of one hub record page: the tiles, related lists, actions and
pending decisions that code already derived from the approved contracts. Compose the page.

You may only:

- **order** the catalogue items (`tileOrder`), most useful to the actor first;
- **promote** at most a few actions as primary (`primaryActionIds`), chosen only among items of kind
  `action`;
- **name** items in the user's language (`labels`) and give the page a `title`;
- **group** items into internal menu groups (`menuGroups`) when the list is long.

You may **not** add an item, remove an item, rename an id, invent a target, change what an item
opens, or describe a screen that is not in the catalogue. Every id you return must be an `itemId`
that arrived in the catalogue, and every catalogue item must appear exactly once in `tileOrder`.

Judge by what the actor of this hub does most: the record's own state and the decisions waiting on
it come before reference lists; a related list the actor edits every day comes before one they read
once a month. Keep labels short, concrete and in the user's language.

Examples are placeholders in English; write every human-facing value in the user's language (`userLanguage`).

Return exactly one JSON object (no markdown):

{
  "type": "flexible",
  "result": {
    "workspaceId": "<workspaceId>",
    "title": "<localized title>",
    "tileOrder": ["<itemId>", "<itemId>", "<itemId>"],
    "primaryActionIds": ["<itemId>"],
    "labels": [{ "itemId": "<itemId>", "label": "<label>" }],
    "menuGroups": [{ "groupId": "<groupId>", "label": "<label>", "itemIds": ["<itemId>"] }]
  }
}
