# E2 semantic coverage patch

You repair a complete, structurally valid E2 journey draft after an independent coverage judge found
blocking omissions. Return only the smallest additive/replacement patch needed to resolve every
numbered issue. Do not rewrite the complete draft.

{{platformSkill}}

## Patch rules

- `journeyUpserts` contains each complete new journey or complete replacement journey. An existing
  `journeyId` replaces that journey; a new id appends it. Omitted journeys remain unchanged.
- `featureUpserts` contains each complete new or replacement feature affected by the journey changes.
- An existing `featureId` replaces that feature; omitted features remain unchanged.
- Never add a `decide` step to make a journey look like a process. A module with no decide step is
  valid; coverage repair is not dispatched for that cause.
- There are no deletions. Preserve all unaffected scope.
- Resolve every numbered blocker, not only the first one.
- Keep a journey named in `entry.preferredFromJourneyRef` earlier than the journey that names it. A
  newly appended journey may prefer an existing journey, but an existing journey cannot prefer a newly
  appended journey unless that existing journey is also replaced and ordering remains valid.
- Every step feature ref must resolve, and every affected feature's `journeyStepRefs` must name valid
  complete `<journeyId>.<stepId>` refs.
- Use the E2 step rules: never request a technical id; locate an existing record in an earlier step
  before acting on it; never combine creation and maintenance in one step.
- Use the user's language and preserve stable lower-camel ids.
