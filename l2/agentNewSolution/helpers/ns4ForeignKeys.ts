/**
 * Where a foreign key POINTS.
 *
 * An input's `fieldRef` names the entity that OWNS the field (`BillingLaborAllocation.clientBillingSummaryId`),
 * never the entity the id refers to. Reading the target off that prefix is how the E8 picker check
 * ended up comparing an entity with itself and passing in silence, while 48 command inputs across 15
 * workspaces asked the user to pick a record the screen could not show. The target only exists in the
 * relationship graph, so it is resolved here, once, for every consumer.
