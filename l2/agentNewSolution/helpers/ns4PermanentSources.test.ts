/**
 * The class guard. Twice the same defect shipped: a step read, as if it were a contract, something
 * that only lives in `pipeline/` — the workspace model (bug_e8_5) and the policy decision bodies
 * (bug_e10_1). `pipeline/` is the working state of ONE run and is discarded afterwards, so anything
 * a LATER step reads must be permanent. This asserts it over the path builders themselves.
