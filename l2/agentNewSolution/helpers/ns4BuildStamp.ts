/**
 * A per-agent COPY of the same ~60 pure lines that live in agentChangeBackend and agentChangeFrontend.
 * Deliberate: importing one agent's helper from another inside 102020 would couple two independent
 * pipelines, and the previous round already decided against promoting this to a shared project.
 *
 * PROVENANCE of the running agent code: WHICH version of this agent produced this run.
 *
 * Not "is it stale?" — that question cannot be answered from inside the agent, and asking it produced a
 * wrong diagnosis once already. What happened on 2026-08-22 (run cb-run-…01-34-27, agentChangeBackend): the MDM F1 was in
 * nobody's build because it had never been committed. The `obj/compiled.zip` in play was perfectly
 * CONSISTENT — its `fileinfos.json` and its `.js` both sat on commit 308ab97 — and the run executed the
 * last PUBLISHED build, correctly. Measured, not argued (on the agentChangeBackend of the incident): the build recorded
 * `1ef6d903…` for one of its sources, exactly `git rev-parse 308ab97:<path>`, while the working copy on
 * the author's disk hashed to `5691b296…`. There was no build bug and nothing
 * to "recompile": what puts code on the platform is commit + push (the `build.yml` Action compiles and
 * commits `obj/compiled.zip`).
 *
 * So the useful line in a trace is not an alarm, it is an IDENTITY a human can match with git.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT DO — by construction, not by omission:
 *   - It cannot see work that was never committed and pushed: the platform has never seen it. No
 *     measurement from inside the agent finds it, by timestamp or by hash.
 *   - It cannot tell whether the built `.js` matches the `.ts` of the same commit. That would be a bug in
 *     the Action, and the place to catch it is there.
 *   - It is NOT a gate: it never blocks, never fails a run, and emits no warning. A source being edited
 *     locally is the NORMAL state of whoever is editing (a file "in development" keeps its local version
 *     instead of the build's `.js` — `cfe-collab-front-end/src/stor/stor.server.ts`), so treating that as
 *     an anomaly would be noise, not signal.
