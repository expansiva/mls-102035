# collab.codes platform baseline

Canonical agent-development references:

- `mls-base/skills/collab_messages.md`
- `mls-base/skills/agentsBestPractices.md`
- `mls-base/skills/modelTypes.md`

The following capabilities are supplied by the platform. Do not create module entities, journeys,
operations or rules that rebuild them:

- authentication, sessions, OAuth2, users, roles and base RBAC;
- tenant isolation and active organization/business context;
- frontend internationalization infrastructure;
- file/media storage and delivery;
- the LLM proxy;
- messages, tasks and the agent runtime;
- monitoring, audit plumbing and basic operational telemetry.

The 102034 runtime also supplies shared MDM persistence, relationship traversal, bulk hydration,
database monitoring and audit infrastructure. Modules define their own business master-record types
and may write organization-scoped MDM records through that platform; they must not recreate the MDM
engine or its common tables. Transactional records remain in the project-namespaced module database.

Mention them as assumptions or external references only when relevant. The generated module must stay
focused on the user's business domain.
